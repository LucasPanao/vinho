<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>
<img src="projetoVinho\static\assets\img\prints\tela-inicial.png" alt="Home Screen">
</p>

This project was an application created for a wine store in Santos / SP - Brazil, with the aim of making it easier for customers to choose wines through their different countries, flavors and vintages.
Here's why:
* The customer could register a multitude of wines and have control over them through the application
* The application was designed for a vertical touch screen like a totem
* The customer already leaves the totem with the order of the wine in hand

The Application is made entirely using Django, so it is possible to use django-admin to control the wine stock and control the users of all employees.

### Built With

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
